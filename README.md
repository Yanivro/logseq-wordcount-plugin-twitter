# Usage

Use `/wordcount`. It will then count the number of words below this parent block. This supports an unlimited number of nested blocks.

You can use more than 1 wordcounter in a single page. Just prefix the blocks you would like to count with another `/wordcount`.

Happy counting!

# Installation

Run `npm i && npm run build` and manually load plugin in Logseq
